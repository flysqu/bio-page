                    Movies and TV shows. I enjoy those too! My favorite movie has gotta be Nimona! Its so much fun and has a really awesome message, watch it!!!!
                    Heartstopper is probably my favorite non-animated tv show, im such a huge fan of hearstopper in general i have all the comics!
                    I also watch anime thats probably the type of media i consume most to be honest
